# C & C++ in zhengrr's eyes

一份为zhengrr定制化的，关于C语言、C++语言、以及相关和不那么相关技术的备忘。

## 关于编程语言

> Everyone knows it's a mistake to write your whole program by hand in machine language.
> What's less often understood is that there is a more general principle here:
> that if you have a choice of several languages, it is, all other things being equal, a mistake to program in anything but the most powerful one.
